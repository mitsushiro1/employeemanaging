## Description

I was motivated to learn more about mysql and how information comes as a table.
I made this project as a challenge for me to use sql and input data sheets which I know this skill would come in handy later.
This would show employees, connection to them and their departments, roles, managers and their salaries
I learned about the relationship between the javascript and sql and how they can communicate with each other.

## Installation

clone the code, make sure to source the sql before you run server.js on the terminal and choose whatever that is prompted on the screen

## Usage

once you run node server.js, you will get to choose from one of the options to either add, view or update departments, roles and employees.
